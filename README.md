# Delight

Delight is a Ruby gem offering small yet useful extensions to the core Ruby classes. Those extensions are implemented as Refinements, which means they are only available in the scope where they are explicitly activated. This allows you to use them without worrying about polluting the global namespace or causing conflicts with other gems.
